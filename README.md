# SimScriptGroceryStore

**Project Description**\
This project aims to model a queue system with multiple inputs and servers in the form of a grocery store checkout. The project simulates queues and customers using [SimScript](https://github.com/Bernardo-Castilho/SimScript) by Bernardo Castilho, which is a JavaScript implementation of the simulation language initially written in the 1960s, and it was initially forked from [a StackBlitz project by Castilho](https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-efht9t?file=index.ts). The projects allows users to select how many queues they want modeled, then spawns customers at an exponential rate with an average of 1 customer per minute. Each customer chooses which line to enter based on how many total grocery items are present in each line. The customer then enters one of the two shortest lines to avoid balancing issues with the lines. When they reach the front of the line, customers enter the checkout area for their line, and wait at the checkout for a variable amount of time that depends on the number of items the customer has as well as some randomness in how long it takes the customer to pay for their groceries and leave. The simulation models this for 12 hours and displays some key features in a bulleted list, as well as statistics auto-generated by SimScript.
